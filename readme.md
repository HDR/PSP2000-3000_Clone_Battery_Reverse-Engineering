# PSP 2000/3000 Clone Battery Board Reverse Engineering

This is a project that is focused on reverse engineering the boards inside Chinese PSP-2000/3000 batteries, hopefully this will help people in making battery mods

# Board

The battery board uses a Chinese microcontroller marked "8052E" where the full part number seems to be [R7F0C80512ESP](/Docs/R7F0C801-805(R7F0C80512ESP).pdf), overall the circuit is very simple, the schematic is available both for [KiCad](/KiCad/PSP2000-3000_BatteryBoard.sch) and as a [PDF](/Docs/Battery%20Board%20Schematic.pdf)

# Todo
- Dump MCU Firmware
